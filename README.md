# Advanced TypeScript Tutorial

Welcome to the Advanced TypeScript Tutorial! This series is designed for those
who prefer a hands-on approach to learning, allowing you to interactively
explore advanced TypeScript features directly in your IDE. Whether you’re
refining your skills or diving into TypeScript's complex types for the first
time, this tutorial offers a structured path to mastery.

## Why This Tutorial?

This tutorial stands out because it encourages learning by doing. You won’t just
passively read about types; you’ll write, break, and fix code, which is, after
all, the best way to learn. Remember, this tutorial is meant to complement the
official TypeScript documentation, not replace it. For more comprehensive
insights and official examples, make sure to check out the
[TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).

## What Will You Learn?

Through this tutorial, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the following
topics:

1. **Generics** - Understand how to use generics to create flexible and reusable
   code.
2. **Utility Types** - Learn how to leverage built-in utility types to write
   more effective TypeScript code.
3. **Mapped Types** - Dive into creating custom type transformations using
   mapped types.
4. **Conditional Types** - Explore the powerful conditional types for more
   dynamic type-checking scenarios.
5. **Intersection and Union Types** - Master combining types to enforce
   structure and consistency across your projects.
6. **Type Inference with `infer`** - Get hands-on experience with `infer` for
   smarter type inference.

## How to Get the Most Out of This Tutorial

- **Interact**: As you go through each file, modify the examples, and observe
  the outcomes. Experimentation is key to understanding.
- **Sequential Learning**: Start from the first module and progress through them
  in order. Each module builds on knowledge from the previous ones.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use your IDE’s TypeScript integration to get immediate
  feedback on the code you write or modify.
