# Advanced TypeScript Tutorial

Welcome to the Advanced TypeScript Tutorial! This series is designed for those
who prefer a hands-on approach to learning, allowing you to interactively
explore advanced TypeScript features directly in your IDE. Whether you’re
refining your skills or diving into TypeScript's complex types for the first
time, this tutorial offers a series of insights into advanced TypeScript
techniques.

## Why This Tutorial?

This tutorial is designed for those who prefer to engage directly with their
development environment. While learning TypeScript can be effective in various
settings, including browser-based sandboxes, this series caters specifically to
developers who enjoy the familiarity and integrated features of their own IDE.

This hands-on approach complements the official TypeScript documentation,
providing an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical
environment. For a thorough understanding of TypeScript's capabilities, check
out the
[TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html).
Whether you’re refining your skills or exploring advanced concepts for the first
time, this tutorial offers a structured pathway through select advanced
TypeScript topics, right from the comfort of your IDE.

## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, you'll need to set up your environment by
following these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open your terminal
and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeOuroumis/advanced-typescript-tutorial.git
cd advanced-typescript-tutorial
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository and navigated into the project directory,
install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Tutorial Files

Each file in this tutorial is a self-contained module that demonstrates specific
TypeScript features. To run any of these files and see the effects of the
changes you make, use `ts-node`, which allows you to execute TypeScript directly
without compiling to JavaScript first. If you haven't installed `ts-node`, you
can install it globally on your system via npm:

To run a specific file, use the following command:

```bash
ts-node <filename>
```

For example, to run the Generics tutorial, you would type:

```bash
ts-node 01_Generics.ts
```

## What Will You Learn?

Through this tutorial, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the following
topics:

1. **Generics** - Understand how to use generics to create flexible and reusable
   code.
2. **Utility Types** - Learn how to leverage built-in utility types to write
   more effective TypeScript code.
3. **Mapped Types** - Dive into creating custom type transformations using
   mapped types.
4. **Conditional Types** - Explore the powerful conditional types for more
   dynamic type-checking scenarios.
5. **Intersection and Union Types** - Master combining types to enforce
   structure and consistency across your projects.
6. **Type Inference with `infer`** - Get hands-on experience with `infer` for
   smarter type inference.

## How to Get the Most Out of This Tutorial

- **Interact**: As you go through each file, modify the examples, and observe
  the outcomes. Experimentation is key to understanding.
- **Sequential Learning**: Start from the first module and progress through them
  in order. Each module builds on knowledge from the previous ones.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use your IDE’s TypeScript integration to get immediate
  feedback on the code you write or modify.
